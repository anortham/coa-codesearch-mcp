# Batch Operations Parallel Execution Fix

## Issue
The `BatchOperationsToolV2` was executing operations **sequentially** instead of in parallel, despite the documentation claiming parallel execution. This significantly impacted performance for AI agents running multiple search operations.

## Root Cause
The original implementation used a `foreach` loop with `await` inside:

```csharp
// BEFORE - Sequential execution
foreach (var operation in operations.EnumerateArray())
{
    var operationResult = await ExecuteOperationAsync(operation, workspacePath, cancellationToken);
    // ... handle result
}
```

This pattern causes each operation to wait for the previous one to complete before starting.

## Solution
Replaced the sequential loop with proper parallel execution using `Task.WhenAll`:

```csharp
// AFTER - Parallel execution
var operationArray = operations.EnumerateArray().ToArray();
var operationTasks = new List<Task<object>>();

for (int i = 0; i < operationArray.Length; i++)
{
    var operation = operationArray[i];
    var index = i; // Capture index for closure
    
    operationTasks.Add(ExecuteOperationWithIndexAsync(operation, workspacePath, progressToken, operationCount, index, cancellationToken));
}

// Wait for all operations to complete in parallel
var operationResults = await Task.WhenAll(operationTasks);

// Sort results back to original order
results.AddRange(operationResults.OrderBy(r => GetOperationIndex(r)));
```

## Key Changes

1. **Parallel Execution**: All operations now start simultaneously
2. **Order Preservation**: Results are re-ordered to match input order
3. **Error Isolation**: Failures in one operation don't block others
4. **Progress Tracking**: Maintains progress notifications for each operation

## Performance Impact

For a batch of 5 operations that each take 100ms:
- **Before**: ~500ms total (sequential)
- **After**: ~100ms total (parallel)

This represents a 5x performance improvement for typical batch operations.

## Testing

The fix maintains:
- All existing functionality
- Error handling patterns
- Progress notification system
- Result ordering
- Response format consistency

## AI Agent Benefits

AI agents can now efficiently:
- Run multiple text searches across different patterns
- Combine file search, recent files, and directory analysis
- Perform comprehensive code discovery in a single batch
- Achieve sub-second response times for complex queries

This fix directly addresses the AI-UX optimization goal of reducing tool call overhead and improving response times.
