## Task 2.4: Add Spell Checking ❌ SKIPPED
**Lead**: 👥 Both Experts | **Duration**: 12 hours | **Days**: 10-11 | **Status**: ❌ INTENTIONALLY SKIPPED

### Rationale for Skipping:
- ❌ **Technical Content Conflict**: Memory entries contain code snippets, technical terms, and file paths that would trigger false positives
- ❌ **Developer Context**: Terms like "async", "middleware", "refactor" are correct but would be flagged as typos
- ❌ **Search Confusion**: Spell correction would interfere with exact technical term searches
- ❌ **Better Alternatives**: Existing fuzzy search (`~`) and query expansion already handle typos intelligently
- ❌ **Implementation Burden**: High complexity for low benefit given existing capabilities

### Alternative Solutions Already Available:
- ✅ **Fuzzy Search**: `~` operator handles typos intelligently
- ✅ **Query Expansion**: Smart expansion suggests related terms  
- ✅ **Context Awareness**: Context-aware search finds relevant content despite variations

**Status**: ❌ INTENTIONALLY SKIPPED | **Decision**: Focus on higher-value features
**Dependencies**: N/A - Feature deemed unnecessary
