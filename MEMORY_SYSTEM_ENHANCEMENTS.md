# Memory System Enhancement Plan

## Current Pain Points

1. **Rigid categorization** - I often struggle to decide if something is an "Architectural Decision" vs a "Code Pattern" vs something else entirely
2. **No cross-referencing** - Can't link related memories or create memory chains
3. **Limited search** - The scopeFilter doesn't work reliably, and I can't do complex queries
4. **No status tracking** - For actionable items, I can't mark them as "done", "in progress", "blocked"
5. **No temporal navigation** - Can't ask "what did we do last week" or "show me all December memories"

## What Would Make It More Useful

### 1. Flexible Memory Schema with Core + Extended Fields

```csharp
public class Memory {
    // Core fields (indexed, required)
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Type { get; set; }  // Can be anything, not just predefined
    public string Content { get; set; }
    public DateTime Created { get; set; }

    // Extended fields (dynamic, indexed)
    public Dictionary<string, object> Fields { get; set; }
    // Examples:
    // - Status: "pending", "in-progress", "done", "blocked"
    // - Priority: "critical", "high", "medium", "low"
    // - DueDate: DateTime
    // - RelatedTo: ["memory-id-1", "memory-id-2"]
    // - Tags: ["performance", "security", "refactor"]
    // - Context: "working on TypeScript integration"
}
```

### 2. Lucene Features We Should Leverage

**Faceted Search** - Let me filter by multiple dimensions:
```bash
recall_context --query "typescript"
              --facets "type:TechnicalDebt,status:pending"
              --date-range "last-7-days"
```

**Boosted Fields** - Make certain fields more important:
- Boost recent memories
- Boost memories I've accessed frequently
- Boost memories with high priority

**More Like This** - Find related memories:
```bash
find_similar_memories --id "memory-123"
```

**Term Highlighting** - Show me exactly what matched:
```json
{
  "content": "Fix the <em>TypeScript</em> server hanging issue",
  "matched_terms": ["typescript", "server"]
}
```

**Custom Analyzers** - Better search understanding:
- Stem words: "running" matches "run", "runs"
- Synonyms: "bug" matches "defect", "issue"
- Code-aware: "IUserService" matches "UserService"

### 3. New Memory Types I'd Find Useful

- **TechnicalDebt** - Things that need fixing but aren't urgent
- **DeferredTask** - Things explicitly postponed
- **Question** - Unresolved questions or unknowns
- **Assumption** - Things we're assuming that need validation
- **Experiment** - Things to try with expected outcomes
- **Learning** - Things I've learned about the codebase behavior
- **Blocker** - Things preventing progress
- **Idea** - Future enhancements or possibilities

### 4. Memory Relationships

```bash
# Link memories together
remember_linked --type "TechnicalDebt"
               --content "Refactor user service for better testing"
               --related-to "decision-123"  # Links to an architectural decision
               --blocked-by "debt-456"      # Links to another tech debt item
```

### 5. Smart Memory Queries

```bash
# Temporal queries
recall_context --when "last-week"
recall_context --when "2024-12-15 to 2024-12-20"

# Status queries
recall_context --type "TechnicalDebt" --status "pending" --order-by "priority"

# Relationship queries
recall_context --related-to "memory-123" --depth 2  # Find memories up to 2 links away

# Context-aware queries
recall_context --context "current-file:UserService.cs"  # Memories relevant to what I'm looking at
```

### 6. Memory Lifecycle Management

```bash
# Update memory status
update_memory --id "debt-123" --status "in-progress" --assigned-to "current-session"

# Archive old memories
archive_memories --type "WorkSession" --older-than "30-days"

# Memory templates
create_memory_from_template --template "code-review" --file "UserService.cs"
```

### 7. AI-Specific Features

**Working Memory** - Temporary memories for current session:
```bash
remember_working --content "User wants to refactor auth system"
                --expires "end-of-session"
```

**Memory Summarization** - Compress old memories:
```bash
summarize_memories --type "WorkSession" --older-than "7-days"
```

**Smart Recall** - Let me describe what I need:
```bash
recall_context "I need to find that security issue we discussed about user tokens"
# AI-powered search that understands intent, not just keywords
```

### 8. Integration Features

**Git Integration:**
```bash
remember_commit --sha "abc123" --description "Major refactor of auth system"
```

**File Context:**
```bash
memories_for_file --path "UserService.cs"  # All memories that mention this file
```

**Memory Dashboard:**
```bash
memory_dashboard  # Shows statistics, pending items, recent activity
```

## Key Insight

Memories aren't just static notes - they're living entities that need to be tracked, updated, linked, and queried in sophisticated ways. By leveraging Lucene's full power and adding these features, the memory system would become a true "second brain" that helps maintain context and continuity across sessions.
