# Recall Project Context

Please recall relevant context for our current work using the memory system.

Use the `recall_context` tool to search for:
1. Recent work sessions
2. Architectural decisions related to current files
3. Code patterns we've established
4. Any security rules or compliance requirements

Also list any active TODOs or unfinished work from previous sessions.

Present the information in a concise, actionable format.
