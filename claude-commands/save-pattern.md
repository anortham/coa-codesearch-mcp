# Save Code Pattern

Please save the code pattern we just implemented or discovered using the memory system.

Use the `remember_pattern` tool to capture:
1. Description of the pattern
2. Where it's located or implemented
3. When and how to use this pattern
4. Related files that demonstrate it
5. Any relevant tags

This helps ensure consistent implementation across the codebase.

After saving, confirm what was stored.
