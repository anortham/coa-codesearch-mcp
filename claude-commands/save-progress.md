# Save Current Progress

Please save a summary of what we've accomplished in this session using the memory system.

Use the `remember_session` tool to capture:
1. A clear summary of what was done
2. Files that were worked on or modified
3. Any important decisions or discoveries
4. Next steps or remaining work

This helps with continuity between sessions.

After saving, provide a brief summary of what was stored.
