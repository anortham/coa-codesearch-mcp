# üéØ Claude's CodeSearch MCP Wishlist

*Generated on 2025-01-19 - Development roadmap for future enhancements*

## üî• Top Priority - Game Changers

### 1. Natural Language Code Search üß†
**What**: Query code using natural language instead of exact syntax
```
Instead of: "find references to UserService" 
I want: "show me all authentication logic"
       "find database connection code"
       "where do we handle file uploads?"
```

**Implementation**: 
- Semantic layer + LLM integration
- Enhanced Lucene indexing with concept extraction
- Query understanding engine
- 10-12 week implementation
- Cost: $0 (local ML models)

### 2. Cross-Language Intelligence üåç (PRIORITY: TypeScript Support)
**Current**: Amazing C#/.NET support
**Need**: TypeScript for hospital tech stack (Blazor + Vue frontends)
**Next**: Python, Go, Rust, Java for full-stack support

**Hospital Value**:
- API contract validation (C# ‚Üî TypeScript)
- Cross-stack refactoring
- Vue component intelligence
- Cost: $0 (TypeScript Language Service)

### 3. Change Impact Analysis üéØ
**What**: "What breaks if I change this interface?"
- Cascade analysis across entire codebase
- Risk assessment with confidence scores
- Automated migration path suggestions

## üöÄ High Impact Features

### 4. Code Generation Assistant
- Auto-generate unit tests from method signatures
- Create DTOs from API contracts  
- Generate builders, factories, adapters

### 5. Architecture Visualization
- Dependency graphs with hotspot highlighting
- Circular dependency detection with fix suggestions
- Module coupling analysis

### 6. Performance Intelligence
- Async/await pattern analysis
- Database query optimization hints
- Memory allocation hotspots

## üí° Developer Experience Enhancers

### 7. Context-Aware Recommendations
```
Working on: UserController.cs
Suggest: Related services, DTOs, tests, docs
Predict: Files you'll likely need next
```

### 8. Documentation Intelligence
- Auto-update API docs from code changes
- Generate README sections from code analysis
- Explain complex algorithms in plain English

### 9. Security & Quality Scanner
- SQL injection vulnerability detection
- Authentication flow analysis
- Code smell detection with fix suggestions

## üè• Hospital-Specific Priority Stack

1. **TypeScript Support** (Week 1-6) - Critical for Blazor/Vue integration
2. **Natural Language Search** (Week 7-18) - Developer productivity
3. **Change Impact Analysis** (Week 19-24) - Safety for patient systems
4. **Security Scanner** (Week 25-30) - HIPAA compliance focus

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

| Feature | Implementation Cost | Monthly Cost | Value |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| TypeScript Support | $0 | $0 | Huge |
| Natural Language Search | $0 | $0-10 | Game Changer |
| Architecture Visualization | $0 | $0 | High |
| Security Scanner | $0 | $0 | Critical |

*All features can be implemented with free, open-source tools*

## üéØ Success Metrics

- **Developer Velocity**: 50% faster code navigation
- **Bug Reduction**: 30% fewer cross-language integration issues
- **Onboarding**: New developers productive in days, not weeks
- **Code Quality**: Automated detection of architectural violations
