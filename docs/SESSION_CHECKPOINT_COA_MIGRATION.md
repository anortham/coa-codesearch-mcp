# Session Checkpoint - COA Framework Migration Plan Completion

**Checkpoint ID**: `COA_MIGRATION_PLAN_COMPLETE_20250805`
**Date**: 2025-08-05
**Type**: WorkSession

## Accomplished

- **Analyzed COA MCP Framework's AI optimization features** including token management, response caching, and intelligent insights
- **Created comprehensive migration plan** for adopting COA MCP Framework NuGet packages in CodeSearch
- **Documented detailed pre-migration assessment checklist** with environment setup requirements
- **Created step-by-step migration checklist** covering 7 phases from setup to post-deployment
- **Developed concrete migration example** for TextSearchTool showing complete transformation
- **Established testing strategy and rollback procedures** for safe migration

## Current State

The CodeSearch MCP project now has a complete migration plan ready for adopting the COA MCP Framework. The plan includes detailed documentation, checklists, and a concrete example showing how to migrate tools to use the framework's AI optimization features. The migration will use NuGet packages from the internal COA feed rather than copying code.

## Next Steps

1. **Get team approval** for the migration plan and timeline
2. **Verify access** to internal COA NuGet feed and configure NuGet.config
3. **Create feature branch** 'feature/coa-framework-migration'
4. **Set up test environment** with framework packages
5. **Begin pilot migration** with TextSearchTool following the example
6. **Implement custom reduction strategies** for CodeSearch-specific needs
7. **Create response builders** for each tool category
8. **Migrate remaining tools** in priority order per the plan
