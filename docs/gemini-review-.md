My evaluation is complete. The critical issues are the SearchAndReplaceTool word boundary bug, the RecentFilesTool performance issue,
and the missing token optimization. I also recommend addressing the architectural inconsistency and incomplete tests. I'm ready to
present my findings, starting with the SearchAndReplaceTool issue.Here are my findings and recommendations, starting with the most
critical.

### 1. Critical Bug in SearchAndReplaceTool

Issue: The SearchAndReplaceTool's "code" search uses string.Contains, causing incorrect matches by ignoring word boundaries. For
example, replacing user also replaces username.

Recommendation: Fix this by using regular expressions with word boundaries (\b) for the "code" search type to ensure only whole words
are matched.

Proposed Change (`SearchAndReplaceTool.cs`):

`csharp
// in ContainsPattern method, around line 293
private bool ContainsPattern(string line, SearchAndReplaceParams parameters)
{
var comparison = parameters.CaseSensitive ? StringComparison.Ordinal : StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase;

      return parameters.SearchType.ToLowerInvariant() switch
      {
          "regex" => Regex.IsMatch(line, parameters.SearchPattern,
              parameters.CaseSensitive ? RegexOptions.None : RegexOptions.IgnoreCase),
          "literal" => line.Contains(parameters.SearchPattern, comparison),
          "code" => Regex.IsMatch(line, $@"\b{Regex.Escape(parameters.SearchPattern)}\b",
              parameters.CaseSensitive ? RegexOptions.None : RegexOptions.IgnoreCase), // Use word boundaries for "code" search
          _ => line.Contains(parameters.SearchPattern, comparison)
      };

}
`

### 2. Performance Issue in RecentFilesTool

Issue: The RecentFilesTool inefficiently filters for recent files in memory instead of using a NumericRangeQuery in Lucene, which
will not scale.

Recommendation: Refactor the tool to use a NumericRangeQuery on the last_modified field for efficient, scalable filtering.

Proposed Changes (`RecentFilesTool.cs`):

1.  In ExecuteInternalAsync, replace var query = new MatchAllDocsQuery(); with var query = CreateRecentFilesQuery(cutoffTime);.
2.  Remove the manual foreach loop that filters results in memory.
3.  Pass maxResults to the \_luceneIndexService.SearchAsync call instead of a hardcoded 500.

### 3. Missing Token Optimization

Issue: Token optimization is disabled due to a conflict between AddMcpFramework and McpServerBuilder, posing a performance and cost
risk.

Recommendation:

1.  Contact Framework Developers: The best option is to report the conflict and request a fix.
2.  Investigate Internally: If direct contact isn't possible, decompile COA.Mcp.Framework.dll to diagnose the conflict.
3.  Implement Custom Solution: As a last resort, develop a custom token optimization solution.

### 4. Architectural Inconsistency

Issue: Many tools do not use the response builder pattern, leading to an inconsistent and hard-to-maintain codebase.

Recommendation: Refactor the following tools to use the response builder pattern: IndexWorkspaceTool, FileSearchTool,
BatchOperationsTool, RecentFilesTool, DirectorySearchTool, SimilarFilesTool, LineSearchTool, SearchAndReplaceTool, InsertAtLineTool,
ReplaceLinesTool, DeleteLinesTool, GetSymbolsOverviewTool, and FindPatternsTool.

### 5. Incomplete Tests

Issue: Several tests are incomplete or marked with TODOs.

Recommendation: Complete all pending tests and add new ones to cover recent functionality, improving code quality and preventing
regressions.
