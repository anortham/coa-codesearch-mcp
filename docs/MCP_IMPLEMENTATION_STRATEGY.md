# MCP Implementation Strategy for COA.CodeSearch

## Executive Summary

The COA.Mcp.Protocol currently implements approximately 40% of the MCP specification, focusing primarily on tools capability while omitting resources, prompts, advanced transport mechanisms, and other key features. This strategic plan outlines a phased approach to implementing the missing functionality, prioritizing features that would provide the most value to CodeSearch users while maintaining manageable development effort and risk.

Our analysis reveals that implementing the Resources capability (Phase 1) would unlock immediate value by exposing search results and indexed content as persistent, shareable resources. The Prompts capability (Phase 2) would enhance user experience through guided workflows, while HTTP/SSE transport (Phase 3) would enable enterprise-scale deployments. The total estimated effort is 280-320 development hours over 4-5 months, with potential for 3-5x ROI through improved developer productivity and new use cases.

## Current State Analysis

2. **User Research**: Survey users on most desired features
3. **Technical Spike**: Investigate HTTP transport options
4. **Team Planning**: Identify developers for Phase 1

### Quick Wins (Next Month)
1. **Use Existing Types**: Leverage already-implemented generic types
2. **Documentation**: Update docs to show full MCP capabilities
3. **Community Engagement**: Share roadmap with users
4. **Tooling Setup**: Prepare development environment

### Strategic Decisions
1. **Start with Resources**: Highest value, moderate effort
2. **Defer OAuth**: Complex with high risk, basic auth sufficient initially
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Ship features as completed, don't wait
4. **Open Source Consideration**: Leverage community for testing/feedback

## Conclusion

Implementing the missing MCP functionality would transform CodeSearch from a powerful local tool into an enterprise-ready platform for team-wide code intelligence. The phased approach minimizes risk while delivering value incrementally. Phase 1 alone would significantly enhance the user experience through resources and prompts, while subsequent phases would enable entirely new deployment models and use cases.

The total investment of 8-11 person-months would be offset by productivity gains across development teams, new collaboration capabilities, and the potential for CodeSearch to become critical infrastructure for software development organizations. With careful execution and continuous user feedback, this implementation strategy positions CodeSearch to fully leverage the MCP protocol's capabilities while maintaining its current performance and reliability standards.
