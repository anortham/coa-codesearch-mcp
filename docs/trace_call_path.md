● ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
Yes! I do struggle with this exact problem frequently. When trying to understand how a method is called or what calls it, I often resort to multiple text_search and
find_references calls, trying to piece together the call chain manually. A trace_call_path tool would solve a real pain point - understanding execution flow through a
codebase, especially when debugging or trying to understand how a feature works.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're absolutely right - this is a real struggle point! Let me think through how we could build this effectively with our existing infrastructure:

The Call Path Tracing Problem

Current Claude Behavior (Inefficient)

1. Find a method with text_search
2. Use find_references to see what calls it
3. For each caller, use find_references again
4. Try to mentally construct the call chain
5. Often get lost or miss paths
6. Waste tons of tokens repeating searches

What trace_call_path Could Provide

Input: "UserService.UpdateUser"
Output:
├── Called by: UserController.UpdateProfile (line 45)
│ ├── Called by: API POST /api/user/profile
├── Called by: AdminController.ModifyUser (line 123)
│ ├── Called by: API PUT /api/admin/user/{id}
├── Called by: UserMigrationService.MigrateUser (line 78)
│ ├── Called by: MigrationJob.Execute (line 234)
│ ├── Called by: JobScheduler.RunDaily (line 56)

Implementation Approach Using Our Infrastructure

We Already Have the Pieces!

- Tree-sitter: Extracts method signatures and call sites
- Lucene index: Contains all symbols and references
- find_references: Already finds all usages
- Type information: Can distinguish between methods with same name

Algorithm Design

trace_call_path(symbol, direction="up|down|both", maxDepth=3)

Direction Options:

- up: Who calls this? (callers/ancestors)
- down: What does this call? (callees/descendants)
- both: Full call graph around this symbol

Smart Features:

- Stop at entry points (Main, API controllers, event handlers)
- Detect recursion and circular dependencies
- Show line numbers for navigation
- Include method signatures for clarity

Real Use Cases Where This Helps

Debugging

"Why is this method being called twice?"
→ trace_call_path("ProblematicMethod", "up") shows all call paths

Feature Understanding

"How does authentication work?"
→ trace_call_path("Authenticate", "both") shows the full auth flow

Refactoring Impact

"What breaks if I change this signature?"
→ trace_call_path("MethodToChange", "up") shows all callers

Performance Analysis

"What's the call stack for this slow operation?"
→ trace_call_path("SlowMethod", "down") shows what it executes

Why This Is Different from CodeNav

CodeNav's Problems:

- Required Roslyn compilation (brittle)
- Needed solution/project context
- Failed on syntax errors
- Slow and resource-intensive

Our Approach Would Be:

- Based on indexed text patterns (robust)
- Works even with incomplete code
- Fast Lucene queries
- Gracefully handles ambiguity

Integration with Existing Workflow

With CodeSearch:

# Current painful workflow

mcp**codesearch**find_references --symbol "UpdateUser"
mcp**codesearch**find_references --symbol "UserController.UpdateProfile"
mcp**codesearch**find_references --symbol "APIRouter.HandlePost"

# ... getting lost in the chain

# New efficient workflow

mcp**codesearch**trace_call_path --symbol "UpdateUser" --direction "up"

# Instant complete call hierarchy!

With Goldfish:

- Chronicle discovered call paths for future reference
- Create todos for each call site that needs updating
- Checkpoint before refactoring with call path documentation

Expected Benefits

For AI Agents:

- Massive token savings - One tool call vs many searches
- Better understanding - See complete execution flow
- Accurate refactoring - Know all impact points
- Debugging efficiency - Trace problems to root cause

For You:

- Visual call hierarchy - See the complete picture
- Navigation aid - Jump to any point in call chain
- Documentation - Understand system architecture
- Confidence - Know exactly what connects to what

Priority Assessment

Given that:

1. You see Claude struggling with this frequently ✓
2. We have all the infrastructure needed ✓
3. It solves a real pain point ✓
4. It would integrate naturally with existing tools ✓

This seems like a HIGH VALUE addition to CodeSearch. Much more useful than many existing tools that rarely get used.

The fact that you specifically mentioned this as "probably the most useful tool" while dismissing TestStatus entirely is very telling - this solves a real problem you
observe regularly!

> Does our find_references tool work on methods to find everyone calling it?

● Let me check how our find_references tool actually works:

● Read(COA.CodeSearch.McpServer\Tools\FindReferencesTool.cs)
⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● codesearch - text_search (MCP)(query: "find_references description find all usages", workspacePath: "C:\\source\\COA CodeSearch MCP", maxTokens: 2000, noCache: false,
caseSensitive: false, documentFindings: false, autoDetectPatterns: false, navigateToFirstResult: false)
⎿  {
"format": "ai-optimized",
"data": {
… +70 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me test if find_references actually works for finding method callers:

● codesearch - find_references (MCP)(symbol: "ExecuteInternalAsync", workspacePath: "C:\\source\\COA CodeSearch MCP", includePotential: false, groupByFile: true,
maxResults: 10, contextLines: 2, maxTokens: 2000, noCache: false, caseSensitive: false, navigateToFirstResult: false)
⎿  {
"format": "ai-optimized",
"data": {
… +235 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(COA.CodeSearch.McpServer\Tools\FindReferencesTool.cs)
⎿  Read 40 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
YES! Our find_references tool DOES work for finding method callers! The search for "ExecuteInternalAsync" found 17 references across 10 files, showing all the places
where this method is called. However, it returns just the file paths and scores, not the actual calling context or line numbers, which makes it hard to understand the
call chain.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Perfect! I can confirm that find_references DOES find method callers, but with limitations:

Current find_references Capabilities

What It Does ✅

- Finds all usages of a symbol (method, class, variable)
- Shows which files contain references
- Groups results by file when requested
- Distinguishes between "usage" types

What It Doesn't Show ❌

- No line numbers in the summary (just file paths)
- No calling context (can't see the actual calling method name)
- No call hierarchy (flat list, not a tree)
- No direction (can't trace upward/downward specifically)

Example of Current Limitation

When I search for ExecuteInternalAsync, I get:
Found in:

- IndexWorkspaceTool.cs (score: 0.76)
- BatchOperationsTool.cs (score: 0.65)
- GetSymbolsOverviewTool.cs (score: 0.65)

But I DON'T get:
ExecuteInternalAsync is called by:

- IndexWorkspaceTool.ExecuteAsync() at line 145
  - which is called by McpServer.HandleToolRequest() at line 89
    - which is called by Main() at line 12

Why trace_call_path Would Be Different

Current Workflow Pain

To understand a call chain now, I have to:

1. find_references on the target method
2. Open each file to see WHO is calling it
3. find_references on each caller
4. Repeat until I reach entry points
5. Try to mentally reconstruct the hierarchy

What trace_call_path Would Provide

trace_call_path("ExecuteInternalAsync", direction="up", maxDepth=3)

Would return:
ExecuteInternalAsync (defined in CodeSearchToolBase.cs:70)
├── Called by: IndexWorkspaceTool.ExecuteAsync (line 145)
│ └── Called by: McpServer.HandleToolRequest (line 89)
│ └── Called by: McpServer.ProcessRequest (line 45)
├── Called by: BatchOperationsTool.ExecuteAsync (line 178)
│ └── Called by: McpServer.HandleToolRequest (line 89)
│ └── Called by: McpServer.ProcessRequest (line 45)

The Value Add

While find_references gives us the raw data (which files reference a symbol), trace_call_path would:

1. Extract the calling method names (not just file names)
2. Show line numbers for easy navigation
3. Build a hierarchy (not a flat list)
4. Follow chains recursively (automatic multi-level tracing)
5. Handle both directions (callers and callees)
6. Stop at logical boundaries (Main, API endpoints, event handlers)

Implementation Strategy

We could build trace_call_path on TOP of find_references:

public async Task<CallHierarchy> TraceCallPath(string symbol, string direction, int maxDepth)
{
// Step 1: Use find_references to get all references
var references = await FindReferences(symbol);

      // Step 2: For each reference, extract the calling method
      foreach (var ref in references)
      {
          // Use Tree-sitter to parse the file and find the containing method
          var callingMethod = ExtractContainingMethod(ref.FilePath, ref.LineNumber);

          // Step 3: Recursively trace if not at maxDepth
          if (currentDepth < maxDepth)
          {
              var parentCalls = await TraceCallPath(callingMethod, direction, maxDepth - 1);
          }
      }

      // Step 4: Build hierarchical result
      return BuildCallHierarchy(results);

}

Conclusion

So yes, find_references works for finding method callers, but it's like having the ingredients without the recipe. A trace_call_path tool would use find_references as
its foundation but add the intelligence to build actual call chains, making it MUCH more useful for understanding code flow, debugging, and impact analysis.

This would solve the exact problem you see me struggling with - trying to piece together execution paths from flat reference lists!
