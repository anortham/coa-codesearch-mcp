# COA CodeSearch MCP - Framework Migration

## Overview

This folder contains the comprehensive migration plan for transitioning COA CodeSearch MCP from its custom MCP implementation to the COA MCP Framework v1.1.

## Migration Documents

### 1. [Migration Assessment](./COA_FRAMEWORK_MIGRATION_ASSESSMENT.md)
**Purpose**: Evaluates the feasibility and benefits of migration
- Current state analysis
- Framework comparison
- Risk assessment
- Expected benefits
- Success metrics

**Key Finding**: Migration is strongly recommended with 30-40% code reduction expected.

### 2. [Migration Plan](./COA_FRAMEWORK_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)
**Purpose**: Detailed step-by-step migration strategy
- 15-day phased approach
- Tool-by-tool migration guide
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Rollback procedures
- Communication plan

**Timeline**: 3 weeks (15 working days)

### 3. [Migration Checklist](./COA_FRAMEWORK_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md)
**Purpose**: Actionable task tracking
- Day-by-day task breakdown
- Tool migration tracking
- Verification checkpoints
- Sign-off requirements

**Use**: Print and check off items as completed

## Quick Start

1. **Review Phase**: Read the assessment to understand the scope
2. **Planning Phase**: Review the detailed plan with your team
3. **Execution Phase**: Use the checklist to track progress
4. **Validation Phase**: Follow testing procedures in the plan

## Key Benefits of Migration

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
