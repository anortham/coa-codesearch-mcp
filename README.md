### macOS Tree-sitter Setup

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important for macOS users:** This project uses Tree-sitter for advanced type extraction from 25+ languages. The NuGet package doesn't ship native Darwin libraries, so you need to install them manually:

#### Quick Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Install Tree-sitter runtime via Homebrew
brew install tree-sitter

# 2. Build grammar libraries using our automation script
sh scripts/build-grammars-macos.sh
```

This builds the most common grammars: C#, TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, JSON, HTML, CSS, and Bash.

#### Custom Installation Directory
If you want to install in a local directory instead of Homebrew's default location:

```bash
# Build to custom directory
DEST_DIR="$PWD/native" sh scripts/build-grammars-macos.sh

# Then set the environment variable for runtime discovery
export TREE_SITTER_NATIVE_PATHS="$PWD/native:/opt/homebrew/lib:/usr/local/lib"
```

#### Build Specific Grammars Only
```bash
# Build only C# and TypeScript grammars
GRAMMARS="c-sharp typescript" sh scripts/build-grammars-macos.sh
```

#### Manual Verification
After setup, verify the installation:
```bash
# Check installed libraries
ls /opt/homebrew/lib/libtree-sitter*.dylib

# For Intel Macs, check:
ls /usr/local/lib/libtree-sitter*.dylib
```

The build script automatically detects your Mac architecture (Apple Silicon vs Intel) and adjusts paths accordingly.

### Linux Tree-sitter Setup

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important for Linux users:** Similar to macOS, Linux users need to install Tree-sitter libraries manually for advanced type extraction from 25+ languages:

#### Quick Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Install Tree-sitter runtime via your package manager
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt install libtree-sitter-dev

# Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:
sudo dnf install tree-sitter-devel
# or: sudo yum install tree-sitter-devel

# Arch Linux:
sudo pacman -S tree-sitter

# 2. Build grammar libraries using our automation script
bash scripts/build-grammars-linux.sh
```

This builds the most common grammars: C#, TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, JSON, HTML, CSS, and Bash.

#### Custom Installation Directory
If you want to install in a local directory instead of system paths:

```bash
# Build to custom directory
DEST_DIR="$PWD/native" bash scripts/build-grammars-linux.sh

# Then set the environment variable for runtime discovery
export TREE_SITTER_NATIVE_PATHS="$PWD/native:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
```

#### Build Specific Grammars Only
```bash
# Build only C# and TypeScript grammars
GRAMMARS="c-sharp typescript" bash scripts/build-grammars-linux.sh
```

#### Manual Verification
After setup, verify the installation:
```bash
# Check installed libraries
ls /usr/local/lib/libtree-sitter*.so
# or: ls /usr/lib/libtree-sitter*.so
# or: ls /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtree-sitter*.so
```

The build script automatically detects common Linux library paths and supports various distributions.

## üîí Security & Thread Safety

### Path Validation
The PathResolutionService implements comprehensive path validation:
- **Directory traversal protection**: Blocks paths containing ".." sequences
- **Path length validation**: Prevents excessively long paths (240+ characters)
- **Input sanitization**: Validates and normalizes all workspace paths
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Handles path separators and special folders

### Thread Safety
- **Concurrent metadata access**: Semaphore locks protect workspace metadata files
- **Atomic file operations**: Metadata updates use temporary files with atomic replacement
- **Lock management**: Per-file locking prevents corruption during concurrent access
- **Safe file system operations**: All I/O operations include error handling and fallbacks

### API Security
- **Path resolution**: Internal hash directories never exposed via HTTP API
- **Real path validation**: Only existing, accessible workspace paths are returned
- **URL encoding support**: Handles special characters in workspace paths
- **Fallback handling**: Gracefully handles unresolvable or corrupted metadata

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration via `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "CodeSearch": {
    "BasePath": "~/.coa/codesearch",
    "LogsPath": "~/.coa/codesearch/logs",
    "Lucene": {
      "IndexRootPath": ".coa/codesearch/indexes",
      "MaxIndexingConcurrency": 8,

      "Enabled": true,
      "MaxCacheSize": 1000,
      "CacheDuration": "00:15:00"
    }
  }
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

  - Indexes stored locally within the primary workspace directory
  - Each workspace gets its own isolated index for fast, context-aware search
  - Supports multiple workspace projects from single CodeSearch session
- **Cross-Platform Lock Management**: SimpleFSLockFactory ensures compatibility across macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Logs**: `~/.coa/codesearch/logs/` (global logging location)
- **Configuration**: Per-workspace settings with workspace-specific isolation

### Framework Integration
Built on **COA MCP Framework 2.0.1**:
- Automatic tool discovery
- Token optimization
- Progressive response disclosure
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Memory pressure management

### Search Engine
- **Lucene.NET 4.8.0** backend
- **Custom CodeAnalyzer** for programming language patterns
- **Multi-factor scoring** with path relevance, recency, and type matching
- **Configurable analyzers** per file type

## üß™ Development

### Building

```bash
# Debug build
dotnet build -c Debug

# Release build  
dotnet build -c Release

# Run tests
dotnet test
```

### Testing

```bash
# Test indexing
mcp__codesearch__index_workspace --workspacePath "."

# Test search
mcp__codesearch__text_search --query "LuceneIndexService"

# Check system health
mcp__codesearch__get_system_info
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Claude says it can't find files I know exist"**
```
Tell Claude: "Please index my project for searching first"
```

**"Search results seem outdated"**
```
Ask Claude: "Rebuild the search index for this project"
```

**"Claude is responding slowly to search requests"**
- Try asking for fewer results: "Find 5 recent TypeScript files"
- Ask Claude to check system memory: "Check CodeSearch memory usage"

**"Getting index lock errors"**
```
Close Claude Code completely and restart it
```

**Installation issues:**
- Make sure you have .NET 9.0 installed: `dotnet --version`
- Try reinstalling: `dotnet tool uninstall -g COA.CodeSearch && dotnet tool install -g COA.CodeSearch`

### Template Embedding Fix (v2.1.4+)

**Background:** Prior to v2.1.4, CodeSearch would fail to connect in workspaces other than the development workspace due to attempting to load instruction templates from a `Templates/` directory that only existed in the source repository. 

**Solution:** Templates are now embedded as resources in the assembly, ensuring they're always available regardless of workspace location. The `codesearch-instructions.scriban` template is compiled into the binary as an embedded resource.

**Technical Details:**
- Template file: `Templates/codesearch-instructions.scriban`
- Embedded resource name: `COA.CodeSearch.McpServer.Templates.codesearch-instructions.scriban`
- Loading mechanism: Changed from file-based (`WithInstructionsFromTemplate`) to resource-based (`WithTemplateInstructions` with embedded content)
- Framework fix: COA.Mcp.Framework v2.1.3+ includes defensive checks for missing template directories

This change ensures CodeSearch works consistently across all workspaces without filesystem dependencies.

### Logging

Set log levels in `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "COA.CodeSearch": "Information"  // Debug, Trace for more detail
    }
  }
}
```

## üìö Integration

### With Other MCP Servers

CodeSearch works seamlessly with other MCP servers configured in Claude Code:

- **Goldfish MCP**: Handles session management, checkpoints, and task tracking
- **Other MCP servers**: Can be combined for comprehensive development workflows

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Search for code patterns using CodeSearch
mcp__codesearch__text_search --query "async Task"

# 2. Navigate to specific definitions
mcp__codesearch__goto_definition --symbol "UserService"

# 3. Find all references to a method
mcp__codesearch__find_references --symbol "UpdateUser"
```
