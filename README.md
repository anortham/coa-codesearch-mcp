# CodeSearch MCP Server

A lightning-fast code search and navigation tool for Claude Code that helps you find files, search code, navigate symbols, and understand your projects instantly. Just ask Claude to "find all my React components", "show me recent changes", or "find the definition of UserService" and get results in milliseconds.

Built with .NET 9.0 and COA MCP Framework 2.1.8, featuring Lucene-powered search with AI-optimized responses.

## üöÄ Features

- **‚ö° Lightning-Fast Search**: Lucene indexing enables instant search across millions of lines
- **üîç Smart Code Analysis**: Custom analyzer preserves code patterns like `: ITool`, `[Fact]`, and enhanced CamelCase tokenization with full generic type support (finds `McpToolBase<TParams, TResult>` when searching for "McpToolBase")
- **üìÅ File Discovery**: Pattern-based file and directory search with fuzzy matching
- **üß¨ Advanced Type Extraction**: Extract types, interfaces, classes, and methods from **26 programming languages** using julie-codesearch Rust CLI tool (includes C#, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, Rust, Go, C/C++, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, and 14 more specialized languages)
- **üß≠ Code Navigation**: Symbol search, find references, and goto definition without compilation

## üîí Security & Thread Safety

### Path Validation
The PathResolutionService implements comprehensive path validation:
- **Directory traversal protection**: Blocks paths containing ".." sequences
- **Path length validation**: Prevents excessively long paths (240+ characters)
- **Input sanitization**: Validates and normalizes all workspace paths
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Handles path separators and special folders

### Thread Safety
- **Concurrent metadata access**: Semaphore locks protect workspace metadata files
- **Atomic file operations**: Metadata updates use temporary files with atomic replacement
- **Lock management**: Per-file locking prevents corruption during concurrent access
- **Safe file system operations**: All I/O operations include error handling and fallbacks

### API Security
- **Path resolution**: Internal hash directories never exposed via HTTP API
- **Real path validation**: Only existing, accessible workspace paths are returned
- **URL encoding support**: Handles special characters in workspace paths
- **Fallback handling**: Gracefully handles unresolvable or corrupted metadata

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration via `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "CodeSearch": {
    "BasePath": "~/.coa/codesearch",
    "LogsPath": "~/.coa/codesearch/logs",
    "Lucene": {
      "IndexRootPath": ".coa/codesearch/indexes",
      "MaxIndexingConcurrency": 8,
      "RAMBufferSizeMB": 256,
      "SupportedExtensions": [".cs", ".js", ".ts", ".py", ".java", ...]
    },
    "FileWatcher": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "DebounceMilliseconds": 500
    },
    "QueryCache": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "MaxCacheSize": 1000,
      "CacheDuration": "00:15:00"
    }
  }
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Hybrid Local Indexing Storage
- **Primary Workspace Indexes**: `.coa/codesearch/indexes/[workspace-name_hash]/` 
  - Indexes stored locally within the primary workspace directory
  - Each workspace gets its own isolated index for fast, context-aware search
  - Supports multiple workspace projects from single CodeSearch session
- **Cross-Platform Lock Management**: SimpleFSLockFactory ensures compatibility across macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Logs**: `~/.coa/codesearch/logs/` (global logging location)
- **Configuration**: Per-workspace settings with workspace-specific isolation

### Framework Integration
Built on **COA MCP Framework 2.1.8**:
- Automatic tool discovery
- Token optimization
- Progressive response disclosure
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Memory pressure management

### Search Engine
- **Lucene.NET 4.8.0** backend
- **Custom CodeAnalyzer** for programming language patterns
- **Multi-factor scoring** with path relevance, recency, and type matching
- **Configurable analyzers** per file type

## üß™ Development

### Building

```bash
# Debug build
dotnet build -c Debug

# Release build  
dotnet build -c Release

# Run tests
dotnet test
```

### Testing

```bash
# Test indexing
mcp__codesearch__index_workspace --workspacePath "."

# Test search
mcp__codesearch__text_search --query "LuceneIndexService"

# Test file discovery
mcp__codesearch__recent_files --timeFrame "7d"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Claude says it can't find files I know exist"**
```
Tell Claude: "Please index my project for searching first"
```

**"Search results seem outdated"**
```
Ask Claude: "Rebuild the search index for this project"
```

**"Claude is responding slowly to search requests"**
- Try asking for fewer results: "Find 5 recent TypeScript files"
- Ask Claude to check system memory: "Check CodeSearch memory usage"

**"Getting index lock errors"**
```
Close Claude Code completely and restart it
```

**Installation issues:**
- Make sure you have .NET 9.0 installed: `dotnet --version`
- Try rebuilding: `cd coa-codesearch-mcp && dotnet build -c Release`
- Verify the path in your Claude Code configuration is correct

### Template Embedding Fix (v2.1.4+)

**Background:** Prior to v2.1.4, CodeSearch would fail to connect in workspaces other than the development workspace due to attempting to load instruction templates from a `Templates/` directory that only existed in the source repository. 

**Solution:** Templates are now embedded as resources in the assembly, ensuring they're always available regardless of workspace location. The `codesearch-instructions.scriban` template is compiled into the binary as an embedded resource.

**Technical Details:**
- Template file: `Templates/codesearch-instructions.scriban`
- Embedded resource name: `COA.CodeSearch.McpServer.Templates.codesearch-instructions.scriban`
- Loading mechanism: Changed from file-based (`WithInstructionsFromTemplate`) to resource-based (`WithTemplateInstructions` with embedded content)
- Framework fix: COA.Mcp.Framework v2.1.8+ includes defensive checks for missing template directories

This change ensures CodeSearch works consistently across all workspaces without filesystem dependencies.

### Logging

Set log levels in `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "COA.CodeSearch": "Information"  // Debug, Trace for more detail
    }
  }
}
```

## üìö Integration

### With Other MCP Servers

CodeSearch works seamlessly with other MCP servers configured in Claude Code:

- **Goldfish MCP**: Handles session management, checkpoints, and task tracking
- **Other MCP servers**: Can be combined for comprehensive development workflows

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Search for code patterns using CodeSearch
mcp__codesearch__text_search --query "async Task"

# 2. Navigate to specific definitions
mcp__codesearch__goto_definition --symbol "UserService"

# 3. Find all references to a method
mcp__codesearch__find_references --symbol "UpdateUser"
```
