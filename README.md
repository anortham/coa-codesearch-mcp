## Installation

### As a Global Tool

```bash
dotnet tool install --global COA.Roslyn.McpServer --add-source https://childrensal.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_packaging/COA/nuget/v3/index.json
```

### For Claude Code

1. Install the tool globally (see above)
2. Add the MCP server using Claude Code CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add coa-roslyn-mcp
```

Or manually add to your Claude Code configuration (`%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_code_config.json` on Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coa-roslyn-mcp": {
      "command": "coa-roslyn-mcp",
      "args": ["stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

### For Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roslyn": {
      "command": "coa-roslyn-mcp",
      "args": ["stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

### For VS Code (via MCP Extension)

1. Install the MCP extension for VS Code (when available)
2. Add to your VS Code settings.json:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "coa-roslyn": {
      "command": "coa-roslyn-mcp",
      "args": ["stdio"],
      "languages": ["csharp", "vb"]
    }
  }
}
```

### For GitHub Copilot (via MCP Bridge)

When GitHub Copilot supports MCP servers, configure it in your `.github/copilot-mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "roslyn": {
      "command": "coa-roslyn-mcp",
      "args": ["stdio"],
      "filePatterns": ["**/*.cs", "**/*.vb", "**/*.csproj", "**/*.sln"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Running the Server

```bash
# Run in STDIO mode (for MCP clients)
coa-roslyn-mcp stdio

# Run with verbose logging
coa-roslyn-mcp stdio --log-level debug
```

### Usage Examples in Claude Code

Once configured, you can use natural language to navigate your C# codebase:

```
"Go to the definition of the UserService class"
"Find all references to the GetUserById method"
"Show me all classes that implement IRepository"
"What errors are in the current project?"
"Rename the Calculate method to ComputeTotal"
"Show me the call hierarchy for ProcessOrder"
"Get the outline of the current file"
```

Claude will automatically use the appropriate MCP tools to fulfill your requests.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with C# extension
- MSBuild (included with Visual Studio or Build Tools)

### Building

```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run tests
dotnet test

# Build for release with AOT
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector coa-roslyn-mcp stdio
```

## Architecture

The server is built with:
- **Roslyn** - Microsoft.CodeAnalysis for code analysis
- **MSBuildWorkspace** - For loading .NET solutions and projects
- **JSON-RPC 2.0** - Standard MCP communication protocol
- **LRU Cache** - Efficient workspace management
- **Native AOT** - For fast startup and reduced memory usage

## Performance

Target metrics:
- Startup time: < 100ms (with AOT)
- GoToDefinition: < 50ms for cached workspace
- FindReferences: < 200ms for average project
- Symbol search: < 100ms for prefix match
- Memory usage: < 500MB for typical solution

### Performance Enhancements
- **Batch Operations**: Reduce tool calls by 60-80% when performing multiple operations
- **Advanced Filtering**: Eliminate manual result filtering with server-side symbol filtering
- **Workspace Caching**: Intelligent LRU caching for faster subsequent operations
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded symbol analysis for large codebases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"MSBuild not found" error**
   - Install Visual Studio Build Tools or Visual Studio
   - The server automatically registers MSBuild on startup

2. **"Could not load workspace" error**
   - Ensure the solution/project builds successfully in Visual Studio
   - Check that all NuGet packages are restored
   - Try opening the solution in Visual Studio first

3. **Authentication errors with COA feed**
   - Set the `COA_NUGET_PAT` environment variable with your Personal Access Token
   - Or authenticate using: `dotnet nuget add source https://childrensal.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_packaging/COA/nuget/v3/index.json -n COA -u YOUR_USERNAME -p YOUR_PAT`

4. **Server not responding in Claude Code**
   - Check that the tool is installed: `dotnet tool list -g`
   - Verify the tool runs: `coa-roslyn-mcp stdio` (should wait for input)
   - Check Claude Code logs: `claude logs`

### Updating the Tool

```bash
# Update to latest version
dotnet tool update --global COA.Roslyn.McpServer --add-source https://childrensal.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_packaging/COA/nuget/v3/index.json
```
